My projects.

1. Heat_Capacity_YIG

   The calculations of heat capacity of cubic crystals at low temperatures were made. The YIG crystal is considered as example.
   The contributions magnons and phonons have been taken into account. The role of magnon-phonon interaction are considered.

3. MEW_Caustic_Patterns_in_cubic_crystals

   The calculations of the caustic patterns, spectrum, constant-energy surfaces of magnetoelastic waves in cubic crystals were made. The Fe82Ga18 is considered as example.

5. ML_projects

   The predictions of Moscow taxi are made.
